## About

I've built my career around solving technical problems and helping team members and users do the same. My path has taken me from office administration, web design consulting, and IT support to software development.

I contribute to MacOS Digital Forensics tools and assist with code modernization, system design, and other technical issues. I particularly enjoy breaking down complex technical challenges into clear, manageable solutions--from mapping out software requirements to helping users resolve system issues.

While I primarily work with C++, Python, and software systems, my real motivation is applying technical expertise to practical problem-solving, ensuring seamless operations.
